Soil fertlity prediction

soil enables various types of plants and crops to grow which are essential for human being and also for the environment, holds and cleans water, reuse nutrients and provides a home for a many of organisms on Earth. Without soil, we wouldnâ€™t be able to grow any crops which will stop the life cycle on earth.
Soil fertility prediction will help to condense the difficulties faced by farmers and act as a medium to bid the agriculturalists efficient
evidence required to get better yield. Once the soil fertility prediction and fertilizer recommendation are fully implemented, it assists agricultural experts such as soil experts, land evaluators, and farmers in determining the level of soil fertility and adequate type of fertilizer to apply for the particular soil this helps in achieving reliable and economic fertilizer recommendation.

Model Selection I experimented with several deep learning and machine learning models, including ANN, DNN, decision trees, and random forests. After comparing the performance of the different models, I chose the 1D-CNN as the final model due to its high accuracy and F1 score.

Model Evaluation The final model achieved an accuracy of 95 % and an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data.
